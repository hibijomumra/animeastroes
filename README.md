# ðŸ˜¼ Anime Astro Frontend

A lite version that made with Astro with vanilla Javascript that will make you easy for learning, if you have already familiar with native html, js, and css here you go. This frontend is fully coded with a Phone { Termux (proot-distro) & Acode } ðŸ“±.

*A Note:* You can use the whole or any part of this frontend components for your needs. This frontend is currently using our API that scrapped from Kuramanime.

*Another Note:* I have no job and also I have physical limitations because of sickness. If you don't mind with that, please hire me ðŸ¥º.
